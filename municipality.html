					<p>Our research started
						with exploratory desk research made of materials provided by the
						municipality such as an architectural layout of the available space, ratings of their services
						(booths, website, and call center service), analytical stats of the website and an overview of all
						the services available. Then, a competitive analysis of other similar buildings has been performed:
						Barcelona's<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> Police Office, Alkmaar's City Office, and Het Kielzog Cultural and Municipal Complex. Finally,
						a Stakeholders' map has been created. As of observation, a general
						observation of activities within the municipality has been done (Fly on the Wall method), together with a behavioural map recording a
						timelapse video from above. Additionally, Contextual Inquiry, Artifact Analysis, and Graffiti Walls methods have been used.
						Finally, Interviews were divided in ethnographic interviews, semi-structured ones, and to conclude, users were
						asked to fill in a Reaction Card sheet.

						<p>The target audience for the municipality is very broad, since there are visitors from different
							age groups, genders and nationalities. There are also both visitors who come there for provided
							services and visitors who come there just to see the building and its beauty.<br>Results of our research
							can be summed up with the following user insights:
								<ul>
									<li>Visitor has too many touchpoint options that would, or combination of them would get him to his goal</li><br>
									<li>Current seating is not ergonomic and welcoming enough thus people find it awkward to sit directly back to back and don't know where they can actually sit if they didn't come to the municipality for services.</li><br>
									<li>Adults and children don't have what to do while they wait for their or their parents' appointment.</li><br>
									<li>Municipality lacks the living room feeling by being white, very airy and usage of cold materials like metal and marble.</li><br>

							<p>Our ideation started with a brainstorming session where each member presented 2 concept each that prepared before
								the meeting. Once gathered together, we started merging the best ideas or single features together building on
								each other's ideas. At the end of this session, we picked 9 ideas totally, 3 for each design direction we had (wayfinding, waiting time, living room).

								<p>After feedback from the client we started prototyping our 4 core concepts and had 3 different types of prototype, each of them tested and refined:
										<ul>
											<li><b>Desktop walkthrough</b>: a cardboard 3D model of the municipality's atrium </li><br>
											<li><b>Service staging</b>: the first life-sized prototype, built in the easiest way</li><br>
											<li><b>In-context prototype</b>: we improved the previous prototype making it ready to be tested with real users</li>
											</ul>

									<h1>Test</h1>
								</div>
								<div class="phase-txt">
									<p>After each test, these were the following insights:
											<ul>
												<li><b>Desktop walkthrough</b>: having an interactive map separated from the ticket machine was not effective, so we combined them</li><br>
												<li><b>Service staging</b>: the first life-sized prototype helped us to have a size of reference and we realized we needed to add a touchscreen below the map</li><br>
												<li><b>In-context prototype</b>: users were curious about our prototype and stimulated by that. The majority of them appreciated it more than the current version. Elderly people were not very enthusiast of learning again how to use municipality services</li>
												</ul>
										   </span>
											 After testing our last prototype, a 2D layout and a poster of our final concept have been presented to the client and employees of the municipality.
											 The concept was appreciated by the client. My main takeout from this project is that straight communication among team members is crucial in order
											 to ensure a smooth and productive workflow. Also, I learnt the importance of prioritization together with time management (lo-fi first and then hi-fi) when drawing the storyboards for our initial concepts because I lost too much time in details that were not needed.
