					<p>The first deliverable for this project has been a set-up where I decided on the methods
						I was going to use for the actual research. Online desk research has been my first method
						and helped me orientate at the beginning of the process, where I decided to dig deeper into
						Runners and the interactions and connections they have with people they deliver at. Then
						ethnographic interviews started: I was gathering qualitative data through open-questions <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
						to participants so they are free to talk; after this session the participants were asked to answer
						some yes/no questions so I was able to gather some quantitative data as well. Fly on the wall was the
						method I used to perform observations. This means users did not know they were observed, so I was able
						to gather data from them while behaving completing naturally. The context of the observation
						is the moment when the package (in this case only food) is delivered to the customer. The triangulation of these three
						macro-categories of user research gave me interesting results that were documented in a research report. How I categorised
						my findings in a colour coded scheme and started creating contexts to be able to formulate user insights is shown in the
						two pictures below. After the analysis of the data I created a user persona of a typical food deliverer in the Netherlands,
						so I was able to have the description of a personality that would represent my target group.

							<p>A brainstorming session was made to empty my mind out.
								Every thought that went through my brain has been written down, then I divided all my concepts and words into
								categories. Staring at the content of those categories, I started writing down some ideas, six in total.
								Lastly an evaluation matrix was used to determine the importance of<span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3">  specific criteria with a scale from
								0 to 5. Usually Yes/No systems are used in these matrixes to evaluate criteria, but I found it more effective
